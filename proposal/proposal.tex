\section*{Introduction}
[Is this too long?]

Dependent types are an extension to the type systems present in many programming languages.
Systems with parametric polymorphism allow these types to be indexed by other types (e.g. \lstinline{List Bool}), meaning functions can be defined generically over an infinite range of types.
Dependent types extend this idea further, allowing types to be indexed over values, as well as types.
One of the most common examples of a dependent type is the type of a List with a known length - (e.g. \lstinline{Vect 4 Bool}).

There are many advantages of adding dependent types to a programming language.
Often performance gains can be made when types are more expressive, as the compiler knows more about them and can make better optimisations.
For example, if length-indexed vectors are used, the compiler does not need to insert index out-of-bounds checks, since it can statically prove they will not occur.
More expressive type systems also allow the compiler to reject a greater range of erroneous programs.
If a \lstinline{Matrix} type indexed by a width and height is used, the compiler can disallow matrix multiplication of matrices with improper dimensions.

My project is to design and implement a language which uses a dependent type system.
I will write a type checker and interpreter for the language in OCaml [?].
To demonstrate the capabilities of dependent types, I will write some small examples which utilise the type system.

\section*{Starting point}

Various dependently typed languages already exist.
There are also a few papers on the topic, which I may refer to.
[Do I need to be specific?]
I will be writing my implementation in OCaml.
I do not anticipate needing to use any additional libraries at this point.

\section*{Resources required}

For this project I will primarily use my own laptop to develop the implementation and to write the dissertation.
I will use git to version control my work and make regular backups to a github repository.
% I will make fortnightly backups to an external hard disk.
I require no other special resources.

\section*{Work to be done}

The project breaks down into the following sub-projects:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Formalise the semantics of a dependently typed language, based on the dependently typed \(\lambda\)-calculus.

\item Prove useful properties of the semantics, such as type safety. [?]

\item Implement an interpreter language in OCaml.

\item Write examples of the uses of dependent types in the language.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Success citeria}

[I'm not sure what a good success criteria/evaluation metric would be?]


\section*{Possible extensions}

[I need to discuss this with Dr Krishnaswami]

\begin{itemize}
	\item Add some form of type inference to the language.
	\item Add more language features such as pattern matching.
	\item Implement a compiler instead of an interpreter.
\end{itemize}
